# WordleTrack

### Introduction
WordleTrack is a word puzzle game inspired by the classic Wordle, with enhanced data tracking and analytical insights. Players will guess a hidden word within a limited number of attempts (6 max). Each day, there will be two difficulty levels: 4-letter words and 5-letter words.
The game will track and analyze player performance through various statistical features. A key feature is the Sort Character Hint, which helps players place yellow-marked letters in their correct positions.

### Project Review
- Two difficulty levels: 4-letter and 5-letter words.
- Tracking and analyzing player behavior with detailed statistical data.
- Sort Character Hint: A feature that sorts misplaced letters into their correct positions.
- Dynamic word selection using a model to adjust difficulty over time.

### Programming Development
**Game Concept**
1. Enter a word guess.
2. Receive feedback on letter correctness 
   - Green: Correct letter in the correct position.
   - Yellow: Correct letter in the wrong position.
   - Gray: Letter not in the word.
3. Can request hints, which are based on their past performance.
4. Continue guessing until they find the correct word or run out of attempts (6 max).

**Object-Oriented Programming Implementation**
1. GameManager: Controls game flow and user interactions.
    - Attributes: Current word, attempts left, difficulty level 
    - Methods: start_game(), process_guess(), end_game()
2. WordBank: Stores words and selects words dynamically.
   - Attributes: Word list, difficulty mapping
   - Methods: get_random_word(difficulty), validate_word(guess)
3. Player: Stores player performance data.
   - Attributes: Name, past scores, hint usage
   - Methods: record_attempt(), update_score(), use_hint()
4. HintSystem: Sort Character Hint
   - Attributes: player_history, current_word, yellow_letters
   - Methods: generate_hint(), sort_hint(last_attempt), analyze_past_guesses()
5. AnalyticsEngine: Collects and processes statistical data.
   - Attributes: Guess attempts, time per round, success rate
   - Methods: calculate_letter_success(), generate_report()

**Algorithms Involved**
1. Letter Frequency Analysis: to suggest letters that are statistically more likely to appear in the hidden word.
2. Word Selection Optimization: Use weighted random selection to pick a word based on the playerâ€™s performance.
3. Sort Character Hint Algorithm: Uses a Constraint Propagation algorithm combined with pattern matching to reposition yellow-marked characters in their correct positions while maintaining relative order.
4. Statistical Analysis of Player Performance: Uses K-means Clustering to group players by skill level.
5. Difficulty Adjustment Algorithm: Provide feedback or recommendations to the player based on their performance across the three fixed difficulty levels.

**Data Analysis Report**
- Bar Graphs â†’ To compare player performance across difficulty levels and visualize trends in hint usage.
- Pie Charts â†’ For displaying win/loss ratios, providing insights into player behavior.
- Distribution Graphs â†’ To understand the range of performance metrics, such as attempts and time taken to solve the word.
- Scatter Plots â†’ To show correlations between various performance metrics, like attempts and time taken.
